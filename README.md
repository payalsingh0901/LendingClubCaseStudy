# Lending Case Study
> This case study provides various relationships across the provided data, which can potentially lead to 'default of loans'. While determining this, we have identified the risky loan applicants and driving factors leading to defaulting the loans


## Table of Contents
* Case Study on driving factors leading to Loan defaults
* Python
* Concluded on a few elements which leads to loan defaults as follows:
- Grades movement from A to G leading to increase in the number of loan default rates
- Loan term increases, loan default also increases
- If the income is verified, there are less chances of getting loan defaulted
- Thanking my buddy as we together collaborated on this to get to this point
